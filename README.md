ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rob

I'm a Roberto from Monterrey, Mexico. I'm currently studying B.S in Data Science and Mathematics Enginnering at Tecnologico de Monterrey. I love coding and I really don't have a favorite language or framework but I do have more experience using Java and Dart/Flutter for software development. This days I'm more into learning Python and utlizing data science tools such as pandas or even using MatLab.
